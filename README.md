# brazil-postal-code
A project that is a result of a challenge done during the course "Java: consumindo API, gravando arquivos e lidando com erros", by Teachers Jacqueline Oliveira and Paulo Silveira! 
It's a aplication made to consume an HTTP API in Java, the ViaCEP API, so when the user type the zip code, the aplication returns the respective address automatically. This challenge was made to exercise the following lessons:  
1) to consume an HTTP API in Java; 
2) to receive and convert information from an API to Java objects;
3) to manipulate data in JSON format; 
4) to use the Gson library to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa.
5) to use classes from the java.io package for file manipulation.
